Here in this folder I split up gustavo's migrated .su file so it could be sent to github (which limits file size to 100mb).
To split the file data_psdmvel2000.su in ten files with ~10mb each I used the comand split:
$ split -b 10M data_psdmvel2000.su data
I think the last file has aproximatelly 5 mb actually.

Then, if I want to retrieve the full data_psdmvel2000.su file I need to download these files: dataaa	dataac	dataae	dataag	dataai	dataak
dataab	dataad	dataaf	dataah	dataaj
and use the comand cat in terminal:
$ cat dataa? > data_psdmvel2000.su

I am not completelly sure if this work around will work, but if it doesn't, I just need to get the original file where Gustavo sent me (can be in my email or in the LGC pc).
